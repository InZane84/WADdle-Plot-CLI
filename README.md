# WADdle-Plot-CLI
Command Line Version


This tool draws DOOM levels within wadfiles 
using Python's Turtle module. It's a WIP but as
it stands, it's neat.

It supports changing the line colors and is
animated.

This release is targeted for Windows and was 
"frozen" using pyinstaller to create the 
executable.

"waddle_plot.exe doom.wad --level E1M6" as an
example of usage.
